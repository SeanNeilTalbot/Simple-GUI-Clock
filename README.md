# Simple-GUI-Clock
I created a simple GUI clock in Visual Studio with Python. It is a nice way to practice label customization with sizes and colors. As well as working with tkinter module

A little more on the tkinter module from Python Wiki

Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.

Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one. CameronLaird calls the yearly decision to keep TkInter "one of the minor traditions of the Python world."
